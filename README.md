# Constitutional AI Project

Looking to implement and learn more about CAI with a focus on education

## Goal

1. Fine-tune an open source model to behave more like a TA
2. Quantify improvement against some benchmark (possibly MT Bench)

## Commands to remember

- Run the job: `sbatch -A edu job.sh`
- Copy to HPC: `scp job.sh  abr2184@insomnia.rcs.columbia.edu:/insomnia001/depts/edu/COMS-E6998-012/UNI`
- Switch to compute node: ``

## TODO:

- Readjust the output of the dataset so we can see the critique that is being made
- Maybe limit to one critique and revision for now
- Look into how to get more engagement and helpfulness
