Blue light waves are short and compact, while red light waves are long and stretched out. When these waves bump into tiny air molecules, the short blue waves get bounced around in all directions (like a small ball bouncing wildly), while the long red waves barely get deflected (like a bowling ball rolling straight through). So when you look up, you see blue light that's been scattered all over the sky, while the red light mostly continues straight from the sun. That's why the sky looks blue to us, but the sun itself still looks yellowish-white!"
